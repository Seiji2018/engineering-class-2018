  <h1>3D Printing and Design</h1>
    <p>What we did is explore the functions and the workings of a 3p modeling program.
    </p>
    <p>I used the inventor program to make various things like a model satalite, a chair, a xylo flyer and a phone stand
    </p>
    <p>I learned the practicality of 3D printing as it makes making things easier as well as the difficulties and time it take to design and build
