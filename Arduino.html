<h1>Arduino Electronics</h1>
<p>I think this was one of the coolest things we've done yet. I was really fun and satisfying how we coded lights to flash. We used an arduino program with a knockoff arduino uno. 
    We learned where the wires go and what they do. Their purpose. We also learned how to the programing works and how to alter the blinking lights, and to respond to buttons.
	I look forward to understanding more of it and maybe learn to program more than just lights.</p>
