<h1>Hey! Seiji Here</h1>
<p>Just to let you know stuff about me, I'm a guy</p>
<p>and I am a halfie, you know, white and asian, </p>
<p>white and yellow...Anyways I can also speak just</p>
<p>enough Japanese to hold small talk with people so most of the</p>
<p>its kind of awkward.</p>
<p>But I digress. I'm a senior at highschool. I'm 5'7" and I have hair.</p>
<p>I also LOVE ramen, had some amazing ramen in Japan while I was there</p>
<p>This is my favorite song, don' worry, its school approriate for the most part</p>
